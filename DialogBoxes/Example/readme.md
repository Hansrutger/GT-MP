This example displays a simple example with commands. Look at the .cs file to see the in-game commands. Simply copy these files into your project (if so you have to change the meta.xml file) or a new project and you should be able to see the result.

Note! The files in /DialogHandler/ are not up to date in this example, please see https://github.com/Hansrutger/GT-MP/tree/master/DialogBoxes/DialogFiles for updated dialogbox files.
